  <h2>About me</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Editing a text (scientific, informative, etc.) makes it clear and accessible to readers.
  How can we, together with the author, fix all the issues and make the text better? That is my job!
  In the future, I wish to develop my skills in micro-copying and learn more about â€˜tone of voiceâ€™ in communication.
  I am a book editor of Social Sciences. I help researchers in history and sociology who wish to publish the results of their research in order to obtain a coherent, comprehensible and adapted text for a specific readership, without renouncing the scientific requirement. </p>
  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I'm part of a podcast project. Our aim is to give voice to women speaking about their love life, focusing on the <em>coming-in</em> This term means the moment when one understand her/his queerness.</p>
